# Day-Trading
I've been trading crypto for a little while now: probably a few years with coinbase (I had already had bitcoin in from mining using nice hash on a 1050ti and 1060). I heard about day trading and started to do some research and came across think or swim. I used think or swim by TD Ameritrade for a few days but was too overwhelmed with what was going on so I went back to coinbase. Someone at school told me a few months ago that there is a coinbase pro with much less fees which is great. I used to trade on coinbase regular but it takes a 2.833% fee on every trade. On coinbase pro statistics are much easier to see and manage and buying/ selling is quicker and easier to manipulate. Also Coinbase Pro only has a .50% maker/taker fee for people with a volume less than 10k. A volume from 10k-50k yields a .35% maker/taker fee. I put in 100$ a few days ago and I've been trading. I have a net volume now of about 4k and I've lost $18 through being impatient and anxious (selling profitable coins too fast). I'm okay with trading very frequently right now and racking up the fees only because it will soon set my volume over 10k where I get the .35% fee which will be nice.

Started using TD Ameritrade Think or Swim for its lack of fees and such. Very complicated but I'm slowly figuring out how to use it.

Getting better at trading and understanding what's going on

I'm ready for them to introduce crypto currencies for the instant trading time

I've been using TD Ameritrade for a few months now and am pretty confident with what is going on. I've made over 50% gains since I started on a few different stocks. Im in NETE right now, an electric car company. Its worth 14.24 at the moment. I plan on holding it for a while longer.
